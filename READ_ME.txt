If you have trouble with missing references or a project not loading check the following:
You have to install MonoGame first. The missing references and “target” files are being imported from/Program Files/ folder, that is why the project is not loading.

Some of us also had to install most recent DX, because the version we have on laptops/machines is not enough.
